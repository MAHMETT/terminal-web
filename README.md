# terminal-web

A web-based terminal: open a browser tab, get a real shell. The shell runs
inside a **tmux** session, so closing the window (or losing your network) just
detaches — your programs keep running and reattach when you come back. Open it
on your laptop and keep going from your phone — it's the **same live session**.

Built with [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) on the front end and a small
Bun + TypeScript server using [`ws`](https://github.com/websockets/ws) and
[`node-pty`](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty) on the back end.

It's designed to live on your **Tailnet**: the server binds to your Tailscale
IP and, by default, has **no application-level auth** — anyone who can reach the
address gets a full shell. To expose it more widely (e.g. behind a tunnel), set
an `AUTH_TOKEN` to gate access with a shared token. See [Security](#security).

**Features**

- **Resumable** sessions (tmux) — survive disconnect, refresh and sleep
- Deep **scrollback** (mouse-wheel, or one-finger drag on touch)
- **Multi-session tabs** — open (`+`), rename (double-tap), close-and-kill (`×`),
  restart (`⟳`); the tab list **syncs across all your devices**
- **Mobile layout + installable PWA** — compact top bar, a sessions drawer, and
  an on-screen key bar (arrows, Esc/Tab/sticky Ctrl·Alt, `^C`)
- **Copy & paste** that works over plain HTTP (no HTTPS required)
- **Attach any file** (button / paste / drag) → upload → insert path, for **Claude
  Code** and other AI CLIs
- Font size, fullscreen, IME (CJK) input, and a `?` help overlay
- Runs over **Tailscale** or any **LAN/intranet** IP; optional **shared-token
  auth** (`AUTH_TOKEN`) to safely expose it beyond your Tailnet
- Optional **background service** (launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux)

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AaronFei/terminal-web.git && cd terminal-web
bun install      # needs Bun, tmux (on Linux also: build-essential python3)
bun run build
bash scripts/start.sh           # binds your Tailscale IP and prints the URL
# no Tailscale?  HOST=192.168.1.50 PORT=8090 bun start   (or HOST=0.0.0.0)
```

Open the printed `http://<host>:8090/`. Want it always-on (start at boot,
restart on crash)? `bash scripts/service.sh install` (launchd on macOS, systemd
on Linux). See [Run](#run) and [Without Tailscale](#without-tailscale-lan--intranet)
for details.

> ⚠️ No login/auth — anyone who can reach the URL gets a full shell. Keep it on
> a network you trust. See [Security](#security).

## Architecture

```
                         WebSocket: /ws?session=NAME
                  binary = raw bytes, text = JSON control
  +-----------------+   <------------------------------->   +--------------------+
  |     Browser     |                                       |   Node.js server   |
  |   (xterm.js)    |  --- input bytes (binary frame) --->  |   ws + node-pty    |
  |  FitAddon       |  <-- output bytes (binary frame) ---  |                    |
  |  WebLinksAddon  |  --- {resize|ping} (text frame)  -->  |   spawns a pty     |
  |  WebglAddon     |  <-- {pong} (text frame)         ---  |   per connection   |
  +-----------------+                                       +---------+----------+
         ^                                                            |
         | static files (/, /styles.css, /dist/*.js, /dist/*.css)    | pty runs:
         +------------------------------------------------------------+  tmux new-session -A -s NAME
                                                                      v
                                                          +-------------------------+
                                                          |     tmux server         |
                                                          |  session "NAME" ------> | your shell + programs
                                                          |  (survives disconnect)  |
                                                          +-------------------------+
```

- The browser streams keystrokes to the server as **binary** WebSocket frames;
  the server writes them straight to the pty.
- The pty's output is streamed back as **binary** frames; xterm renders it.
- **Text** frames carry JSON control messages: `resize`, `ping`/`pong`,
  `restart` and `kill` (session control), and an optional `debug` trace.
- The pty runs `tmux new-session -A -s NAME`, so the same named session is
  reused (or created) on every connect. The tmux server outlives the pty.

---

## Prerequisites

These are CLI prerequisites — they are **not** bundled or installed by this
project:

- **Bun** (ESM, runs the server directly)
- **tmux** — the session backend (`brew install tmux` on macOS,
  `sudo apt install tmux` on Debian/Ubuntu)
- **Linux only:** a C/C++ toolchain + Python 3 to build `node-pty`
  (`sudo apt install -y build-essential python3`) — see [Install](#install)
- **tailscale** — **optional**. Only used to auto-detect which IP to bind to.
  Not installed? It's fine — set `HOST` yourself (see
  [Without Tailscale](#without-tailscale-lan--intranet)).

Development was done on macOS.

---

## Install

```bash
bun install
```

> **Note:** `node-pty` is a native addon. It ships **prebuilt** binaries for
> macOS and Windows, but on **Linux it compiles from source on install** — so
> you need a C/C++ toolchain + Python 3
> (`sudo apt install -y build-essential python3` on Debian/Ubuntu). On macOS,
> if no prebuilt matches your Node version it also compiles, which needs the
> Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`). See
> [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) if install fails.

---

## Build

Bundle the client (xterm.js + addons) with esbuild into `public/dist/`:

```bash
bun run build
```

This produces `public/dist/terminal.js` and `public/dist/terminal.css`
(esbuild derives the CSS file name from the `web/terminal.ts` entry, which
imports xterm's stylesheet). `public/dist/` is gitignored.

---

## Run

### Quick start (recommended)

```bash
bun start
# or, with Tailscale auto-detection and an auto-build if needed:
bash scripts/start.sh
```

`scripts/start.sh`:

1. Warns if `tmux` or `tailscale` are missing.
2. Builds the client bundle if `public/dist/terminal.js` is absent.
3. Detects your Tailscale IPv4 (`tailscale ip -4 | head -1`) and exports it as
   `HOST` (unless `HOST` is already set).
4. Runs `bun start` and prints the reachable `http://<host>:<port>` URL.

`bun start` alone just runs `bun src/server.ts`; the server itself also
detects the Tailscale IP for `HOST` when `HOST` is unset, and logs the URLs it
binds (highlighting the Tailscale one).

Then open the printed URL, e.g. `http://100.x.y.z:8090/`.

### Without Tailscale (LAN / intranet)

Tailscale is **optional** — it's only used to auto-pick the bind address. From
a clean clone the only hard requirements are **Bun** and **tmux**. Without
tailscale, set `HOST` yourself:

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd terminal-web
bun install
bun run build

# bind to a specific LAN/intranet IP...
HOST=192.168.1.50 PORT=8090 bun start
# ...or bind every interface (reachable on all of the host's IPs)
HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=8090 bun start
```

`scripts/start.sh` and `scripts/service.sh install` also work without tailscale
— they just warn, then fall back to the `HOST` you set (or `0.0.0.0`). Open
`http://<that-ip>:8090/` from any machine that can reach it.

> **Security:** there is **no app-level auth** and traffic is plain HTTP —
> anyone who can reach the bound `IP:port` gets a full shell. On a Tailnet that
> is limited to your authorized devices; on a shared LAN it's everyone on that
> segment. Only expose it on a network you trust (or put it behind a firewall).

### Development

```bash
bun run dev   # -> bash scripts/dev.sh
```

`scripts/dev.sh` runs the esbuild watcher (`bun esbuild.mjs --watch`) in the
background and the server with reload (`bun --watch src/server.ts`) in the
foreground. Editing `web/terminal.ts` rebuilds the bundle; editing server code
restarts the server. The background watcher is killed automatically when you
stop the script (Ctrl-C).

---

## Running as a background service (launchd / systemd)

To keep terminal-web running across logins and restarts (instead of a terminal
window you have to leave open), install it as a per-user service. The same
helper auto-detects the platform — **launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux**:

```bash
bash scripts/service.sh install     # write unit, load, start at login/boot + on crash
bash scripts/service.sh status      # show state + an HTTP probe
bash scripts/service.sh logs        # tail the service logs
bash scripts/service.sh restart     # after changing server code
bash scripts/service.sh uninstall   # stop and remove
```

`install` pins the bun path, the repo path, and `HOST`/`PORT` into the unit.
By default `HOST` is your Tailscale IPv4, else `0.0.0.0` (override with
`HOST=… PORT=… bash scripts/service.sh install`). The service auto-restarts if
it exits, with a 10 s back-off so it doesn't hot-loop while the network (or
Tailscale) is still coming up at boot.

- **macOS:** writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.aaronfei.terminal-web.plist`;
  logs to `logs/launchd.out.log` / `logs/launchd.err.log`.
- **Linux:** writes `~/.config/systemd/user/terminal-web.service`, runs
  `systemctl --user enable --now`, and tries `loginctl enable-linger` so it
  survives logout / starts at boot (run `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER`
  yourself if it couldn't). Logs go to the journal
  (`journalctl --user -u terminal-web -f`).

After editing **server** code run `scripts/service.sh restart`; after editing
**frontend** code run `bun run build` (the service serves the prebuilt bundle).

---

## How resume works

The pty doesn't run your shell directly — it runs
`tmux new-session -A -s NAME` (with `-A` meaning "attach if it exists, else
create"). So:

- **Disconnecting** — closing the *browser* tab/window, refreshing, sleeping
  the laptop, or dropping Wi-Fi — closes the WebSocket. The server kills the
  pty, which only **detaches** the tmux client. The tmux *server* and your
  session (every running program) keep going.
- **Reconnecting** opens a new WebSocket, spawns a new pty, and re-attaches to
  the same named session. tmux repaints the screen and you're back where you
  left off.

> Closing a **tab inside the app** (the `×`) is different: it *kills* that tmux
> session for good. So to keep a job running, just close the window or let the
> connection drop — don't press `×`. See [Sessions & tabs](#sessions--tabs).

The front end intentionally does **not** reset the terminal on reconnect, so
your local xterm scrollback is preserved and tmux's repaint lands cleanly. A
subtle "reconnecting…" overlay appears while it retries (capped backoff).

---

## How scrolling works

Scrolling is handled by **tmux**, configured in `tmux/web.tmux.conf`:

- `set -g mouse on` — mouse-wheel scrolling drops you into tmux copy-mode to
  browse history; scrolling back to the bottom returns to the live shell.
- `set -g history-limit 100000` — deep scrollback. Increase this if you need
  more lines retained (it costs memory per pane).

xterm.js also keeps a large local scrollback (`scrollback: 100000`), but tmux
owns the authoritative history (important after a reattach).

> The tmux status bar is hidden (`set -g status off`) for a clean full-screen
> look. To bring it back, comment out that line in `tmux/web.tmux.conf`, or at
> runtime run `tmux set -g status on`.

---

## On-screen keys & control bar (touch / iPad)

iPad/phone soft keyboards lack arrow keys, Esc, Tab, and modifiers, so the page
adds two bars:

- **Top bar** — session **tabs** on the left (see below) and controls on the
  right: `A−`/`A+` (font size, persisted), `⌨` (toggle the key bar), `⟳`
  (restart the session), a **📎 attach** button (attach any file), `⤢`
  (fullscreen), and `?` (a help overlay — also shown once on first visit).
- **Bottom key bar** — `Copy Paste Esc Tab Ctrl Alt ← ↑ ↓ → Home End PgUp PgDn
  ^C | ~ / -`, horizontally scrollable. `Ctrl` and `Alt` are **sticky**: tap to
  arm them (they highlight), then the next key is sent with that modifier — e.g.
  `Ctrl` then `c` sends `Ctrl-C`; `Ctrl`/`Alt` + an arrow sends the xterm
  modified sequence.

The key bar shows by default on touch devices and is hidden on desktop; your
choice is remembered (localStorage). Tapping a key keeps focus on the terminal
so the soft keyboard stays up, and the bar lifts above the iOS keyboard via the
`visualViewport` API.

---

## Sessions & tabs

Each tmux session is independent, and the top bar shows one **tab** per open
session (with a live connection dot). 

- **`+`** opens a new session (you're prompted for a name).
- **`×`** closes the tab **and kills that tmux session for good** (its programs
  are terminated). This is *not* the same as disconnecting — see
  [How resume works](#how-resume-works).
- **`⟳`** restarts the active session: kills it and reconnects into a fresh one.
- Open tabs and the active tab are remembered (localStorage) and restored on
  reload.

You can also pick the session for a fresh page with the `session` query
parameter (handy for bookmarks/links):

```
http://<host>:<port>/?session=work
```

Without `?session=`, the default (`DEFAULT_SESSION`, default `web`) is used.
Names are sanitized to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`; anything invalid falls back to
`web`.

---

## Copy, paste & clipboard

The browser Clipboard **API** needs a *secure context* (HTTPS or
`http://localhost`), so over a plain `http://<ip>` URL it's blocked. This app
works around that so you don't strictly need HTTPS:

- **Select** — tmux mouse mode owns plain dragging, so hold **Option** (macOS)
  or **Shift** (Windows/Linux) and drag to select. Selecting copies
  automatically (via `execCommand`, which works over HTTP), or tap **Copy**.
- **Paste** — on a desktop, click the terminal and press **⌘V** /
  **Ctrl+Shift+V** (the native paste works over HTTP). On touch/HTTP, tap
  **Paste** in the key bar: a small box pops up, you paste into it, and it's
  sent to the terminal.
- On HTTPS (e.g. `tailscale serve`) the Clipboard API is unlocked and the
  Copy/Paste buttons work directly everywhere, including iPad.

The `?` help overlay summarizes these (with the right keys for your OS).

---

## Environment variables

All are optional. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to override defaults. `.env` is
loaded by `scripts/start.sh` and `scripts/dev.sh` (`bun run dev`). Running
`bun start` directly does **not** load `.env` (uses `--no-env-file`); export
the vars in your shell instead, e.g. `HOST=100.x.y.z PORT=8090 bun start`.

| Variable          | Default                                              | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`            | `8090`                                               | Port the HTTP/WebSocket server listens on.                                  |
| `HOST`            | Tailscale IPv4 (`tailscale ip -4`), else `0.0.0.0`   | Address to bind. Set explicitly to pin a specific interface/IP.             |
| `DEFAULT_SESSION` | `web`                                                | tmux session name used when the client doesn't pass `?session=NAME`.        |
| `AUTH_TOKEN`      | _(empty = no auth)_                                  | Shared token required for requests arriving via Cloudflare; see [Security](#security). |
| `UPLOAD_DIR`      | `~/terminal-web-uploads`                             | Where pasted/dropped/attached files are saved (see below).                  |
| `UPLOAD_RETENTION_HOURS` | `72`                                          | Auto-delete uploads older than this (0 = never by age).                     |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_FILES` | `100`                                               | Keep at most this many uploads, newest first (0 = unlimited).               |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_MB`   | `25`                                                 | Reject any single upload larger than this many MB (0 = no limit).           |

---

## Attaching files (for Claude Code & other AI CLIs)

A terminal is a text stream, so you can't paste a file into it directly.
Instead there are three ways to attach **any file** (image, PDF, text, …); each
uploads it to the server (`POST /upload`), which saves it under `UPLOAD_DIR`
(default `~/terminal-web-uploads`) and returns the path, and the page then
**types that absolute path at the prompt**:

- The **📎 attach button** in the top bar — pick one or more files. This is the
  most reliable everywhere (incl. iPad) and over plain HTTP.
- **Paste** a file (Cmd/Ctrl-V) into the terminal.
- **Drag-drop** file(s) onto the terminal.

The saved file keeps its original name and extension (sanitized, with a
`clip-<timestamp>-` prefix). So to hand a file to Claude Code (or any CLI that
reads a path): attach it, then press Enter — the CLI picks up the inserted path
and reads the file. Uploads are capped at `UPLOAD_MAX_MB` (default 25 MB) and
saved `0600`.

To stop the folder growing forever, uploads are auto-pruned on boot and after
each upload: files older than `UPLOAD_RETENTION_HOURS` (default 72h) are
deleted, then only the newest `UPLOAD_MAX_FILES` (default 100) are kept. Only
our own `clip-*` files are touched. Set either to `0` to disable that limit.

> The upload endpoint has no auth beyond the tailnet, same as the terminal —
> anyone on your tailnet can POST a file into `UPLOAD_DIR`.

---

## Security

By default **there is no application-level authentication** — anyone who can
reach the bound address gets an interactive shell as the user running the server.

- Keep it **Tailnet-only**: leave `HOST` pointed at your Tailscale IP (the
  default behavior) so the server is not exposed on your LAN or the public
  internet. Avoid binding to `0.0.0.0` on untrusted networks.
- Lock it down further with **Tailscale ACLs** so only specific devices/users
  on your tailnet can reach the port.
- **Exposing it beyond your Tailnet?** Set `AUTH_TOKEN` to a long random secret
  (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 24`). Requests that arrive **through Cloudflare**
  (detected via the `Cf-Ray` / `Cf-Connecting-Ip` headers it stamps) then require
  the token — open it once with `?token=…` to set a cookie; the WebSocket is
  gated too. Direct Tailnet/LAN access stays token-free. A static shared token is
  **not** a substitute for real auth (no per-user identity or MFA); for stronger
  control, front it with an identity-aware proxy (Cloudflare Access, Tailscale, …).
- The server speaks **plain HTTP** (no TLS), which isn't a *secure context*, so
  the browser's `navigator.clipboard` API is blocked. Copy/paste still works via
  fallbacks — see [Copy, paste & clipboard](#copy-paste--clipboard). For the
  native clipboard (and HTTPS), put it behind a TLS proxy such as
  `tailscale serve`.

Treat exposing this as equivalent to handing out SSH access.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`node-pty` fails to build / `bun install` errors with node-gyp**
`node-pty` is a native addon. Ensure you have a C/C++ toolchain:
- macOS: `xcode-select --install`
- Make sure your Bun version is up to date.
- Try a clean reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && bun install`.

**"tmux: command not found" / sessions don't start**
Install tmux (`brew install tmux`). The server spawns `tmux` per connection
and loads `tmux/web.tmux.conf`; without tmux on `PATH`, connections fail.

**Port already in use (`EADDRINUSE`)**
Another process holds the port. Find it with `lsof -i :8090` (adjust the port)
and stop it, or start with a different port: `PORT=8091 bun start`.

**Tailscale IP not detected / binds to `0.0.0.0`**
Make sure Tailscale is running and connected: `tailscale status` and
`tailscale up`. Confirm `tailscale ip -4` prints an address. You can always
set `HOST` explicitly to bypass detection.

**Client shows "reconnecting…" and never connects**
The server may not be running, or you can't reach `HOST:PORT`. Check the
server logs for the bound URL, verify you're on the tailnet, and confirm the
port isn't blocked.

**Blank page / terminal doesn't render**
Make sure the client bundle was built: `bun run build` (or use
`scripts/start.sh`, which builds it automatically). Check the browser console
for errors loading `/dist/terminal.js`.

**Garbled glyphs / blank terminal on an old or virtual GPU**
The WebGL renderer can misbehave on some GPUs. Append `?webgl=0` to the URL to
fall back to the DOM renderer (e.g. `http://<host>:8090/?webgl=0`).
